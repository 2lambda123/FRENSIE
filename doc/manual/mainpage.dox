/*! \mainpage Overview, Theory and Usage
 * 
 * The Forward Adjoint Continuous Energy Monte Carlo (FACEMC) code is a 
 * shielding code that can be used to model experiments and devices with a
 * virtually limitless level of detail. A unique feature of this code is its
 * ability to model photons and neutrons (and charged particles in the future)
 * in the adjoint on a continuous energy scale. This ability can add an extra
 * degree of freedom when conducting analyses of experiments and devices. The
 * adjoint information that is generated can also be independently useful
 * depending on the calculation that is being done.
