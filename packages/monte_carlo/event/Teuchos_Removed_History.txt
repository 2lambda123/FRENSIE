Core:
1) Removed all but RCP and any from included teuchos objects
2) Replaced Teuchos::any with boost::any. Plan on using shared_ptr for RCP, but must check where it's used to make sure.
3) Replaced everything except for the Teuchos::TwoDArray object in MonteCarlo_UnorderedTypedObserverPhasedSpaceDimensionDiscretization.hpp file.

Dispatcher:
1) Removed all in #include but Teuchos::Parameterlist due to impending redesign of factory classes.
2) Commented out factory classes that use Teuchos::Parameterlist and replaced all other teuchos objects with appropriate objects

Estimator: 
1) Removed everything in #include except Teuchos::Parameterlist due to impending redesign of factory classes.
2) Removed all Teuchos references except for Parameterlist and Teuchos::ReduceAll. Not sure how to do the ReduceAll to allReduce yet.
