\chapter{Symmetry of the Problem from the Third Validation Step}
\label{ch:appendix_D}
It must be noted that this problem is identical to a one-dimensional spherical
problem with a source at a radius of zero and detectors at the radii of the
spheres. This observation will be important for the third step of the validation
plan.
